    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.naver.com/" target="_blank" title="네이버야">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</a> is the code that is <b>used to structure <u>a web page</u> and its content.</b> For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
